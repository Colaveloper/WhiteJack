# WhiteJack

An hybrid of italian playing cards and the old-fashioned darker Jack

Play by attempting to make your card values sum up to 17, but be careful not to go further!

Why WhiteJack? Simple, a friend made me notice that calling a variable bj would have guaranteed my game to get a parental advisor tag ;P
