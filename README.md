# WhiteJack

An hybrid of an Italian card game called _9_ and the old-fashioned darker Jack
Play against the AI by attempting to make your card values sum up to 17, but be careful not to go further!

But why _WhiteJack_? Simple, a friend made me notice that calling a variable bj would have guaranteed my game to get a parental advisor tag XD
